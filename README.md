Electrical Vehicles

Description: Electric vehicles are a great alternative to reduce emissions that contribute to climate change. By reducing these emissions, we can save the environment, get cleaner air, and get better health. This dataset shows the Battery Electric Vehicles and Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles that are currently registered through the Washington State Department of Licensing (as of June 23, 2023).
